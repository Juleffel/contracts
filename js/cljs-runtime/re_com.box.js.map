basis), based on the :size parameter.\r\n   IMPORTANT: The term 'size' means width of the item in the case of flex-direction 'row' OR height of the item in the case of flex-direction 'column'.\r\n   Flex property explanation:\r\n    - grow    Integer ratio (used with other siblings) to determined how a flex item grows it's size if there is extra space to distribute. 0 for no growing.\r\n    - shrink  Integer ratio (used with other siblings) to determined how a flex item shrinks it's size if space needs to be removed. 0 for no shrinking.\r\n    - basis   Initial size (width, actually) of item before any growing or shrinking. Can be any size value, e.g. 60%, 100px, auto\r\n              Note: auto will cause the initial size to be calculated to take up as much space as possible, in conjunction with it's siblings :flex settings.\r\n   Supported values:\r\n    - initial            '0 1 auto'  - Use item's width/height for dimensions (or content dimensions if w/h not specifed). Never grow. Shrink (to min-size) if necessary.\r\n                                       Good for creating boxes with fixed maximum size, but that can shrink to a fixed smaller size (min-width/height) if space becomes tight.\r\n                                       NOTE: When using initial, you should also set a width/height value (depending on flex-direction) to specify it's default size\r\n                                             and an optional min-width/height value to specify the size it can shrink to.\r\n    - auto               '1 1 auto'  - Use item's width/height for dimensions. Grow if necessary. Shrink (to min-size) if necessary.\r\n                                       Good for creating really flexible boxes that will gobble as much available space as they are allowed or shrink as much as they are forced to.\r\n    - none               '0 0 auto'  - Use item's width/height for dimensions (or content dimensions if not specifed). Never grow. Never shrink.\r\n                                       Good for creating rigid boxes that stick to their width/height if specified, otherwise their content size.\r\n    - 100px              '0 0 100px' - Non flexible 100px size (in the flex direction) box.\r\n                                       Good for fixed headers/footers and side bars of an exact size.\r\n    - 60%                '60 1 0px'  - Set the item's size (it's width/height depending on flex-direction) to be 60% of the parent container's width/height.\r\n                                       NOTE: If you use this, then all siblings with percentage values must add up to 100%.\r\n    - 60                 '60 1 0px'  - Same as percentage above.\r\n    - grow shrink basis  'grow shrink basis' - If none of the above common valaues above meet your needs, this gives you precise control.\r\n   If number of words is not 1 or 3, an exception is thrown.\r\n   Reference: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/#flexibility\r\n   Diagram:   http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/#flex-container\r\n   Regex101 testing: ^(initial|auto|none)|(\\\\d+)(px|%|em)|(\\\\d+)\\\\w(\\\\d+)\\\\w(.*) - remove double backslashes\"\r\n  [size]\r\n  ;; TODO: Could make initial/auto/none into keywords???\r\n  (let [split-size      (string/split (string/trim size) #\"\\s+\")                  ;; Split into words separated by whitespace\r\n        split-count     (count split-size)\r\n        _               (assert (contains? #{1 3} split-count) \"Must pass either 1 or 3 words to flex-child-style\")\r\n        size-only       (when (= split-count 1) (first split-size))         ;; Contains value when only one word passed (e.g. auto, 60px)\r\n        split-size-only (when size-only (string/split size-only #\"(\\d+)(.*)\")) ;; Split into number + string\r\n        [_ num units]   (when size-only split-size-only)                    ;; grab number and units\r\n        pass-through?
